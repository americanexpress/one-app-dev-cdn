## üéõÔ∏è API

### `oneAppDevCdn( [options] )`

Loads the local module map and remote module map for local development.

#### options

Type: `object`

provide the options below to load module map, with `localDevPublicPath`  and `appPort` being required parameters.

##### `localDevPublicPath`

Type: `string`

location on the local filesystem where `module-map.json` and `modules` (created by One App's `serve-module`) are. **REQUIRED**

##### `appPort`

Type: `number`

Port on which One App is running. Used in order to set up CORS headers. (i.e. `3000`) **REQUIRED**

##### `remoteModuleMapUrl`

Type: `string`

location where the remote module map is located (i.e. `https://my-domain.com/map/module-map.json`), if this is not provided the local module map will be loaded.

##### `useLocalModules`

Type: `boolean`

Default: `true`<br>
Whether to use modules from `localDevPublicPath`. Passed as `true` or `false`, defaults to `true`.

**Note**: Either `remoteModuleMapUrl` OR `useLocalModules` is required. If both are provided then
the remote module map will be merged with modules from `localDevPublicPath` with the local modules
taking precedence.
